# M5Atom-Matrix-Atomic
Tamagochi-like minigame I've developed for the M5Atom Matrix

This project aims to be a little desk-buddy companion for you to look after as you are doing other tasks, if you hold the button for a little bit, it will take you to a minigame where you have to click as much as possible which will improve your atomic's mood! 

More planned functions: More minigames besides the clicker (snake minigame using the motion sensor), more animations, wifi hacking capabilities (like a pwnagochi) and to transform it into an actual custom firmware to run from the esp32.
